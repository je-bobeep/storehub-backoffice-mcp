   git clone <repository-url>
   cd storehub-backoffice-mcp
   chmod +x setup.sh
   ./setup.sh
   ```

2. **Configure your API credentials:**
   ```bash
   # Edit the environment file
   nano storehub-mcp-server/.env
   
   # Add your credentials:
   STOREHUB_API_KEY=your_actual_api_key
   STOREHUB_ACCOUNT_ID=your_actual_account_id
   ```

3. **Test the server:**
   ```bash
   cd storehub-mcp-server
   source venv/bin/activate
   python main.py
   ```

### Claude Integration

Configure Claude to use this MCP server by adding the configuration to your Claude settings:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "storehub": {
      "command": "/path/to/your/storehub-backoffice-mcp/storehub-mcp-server/venv/bin/python3",
      "args": ["/path/to/your/storehub-backoffice-mcp/storehub-mcp-server/main.py"],
      "cwd": "/path/to/your/storehub-backoffice-mcp/storehub-mcp-server",
      "env": {
        "PYTHONPATH": "/path/to/your/storehub-backoffice-mcp/storehub-mcp-server",
        "STOREHUB_API_KEY": "your_actual_api_key_here",
        "STOREHUB_ACCOUNT_ID": "your_actual_account_id_here"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

**Note:** The configuration above shows the correct format but uses placeholder paths. Your actual `claude-config.json` file should use your real paths and credentials (which are kept local and not committed to version control).
